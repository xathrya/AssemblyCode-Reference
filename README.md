# Assembly Code Reference

Open repository for assembly code reference.

### Overview

This repository is created as an ultimate source for code snippets to demonstrate the assembly programming languages for various platform and dialects. The scope of this repository is not limited to only hardware processor but also expanded to cover various process virtual machine such as JVM (Java Bytecode), CLR (.Net Assembly), etc. 

You can try to compile each code by following the instruction available for each architecture and assemblers.

### Disclaimer

Reversing.ID has no affiliation with any vendor or any device manufacturer. This repository is intended as references for learning assembly language. No product is promoted over the other.

### What is Assembly?

Assembly or assembler is a term for referring a low-level language for instructing the machine. The code consists of several primitive instructions such as data movement, arithmetic operations, conditional, and others. These instructions are the very basic building block for creating complex code running on top of the platform.

Assembly is the heart of Software Reverse Engineering.

### Structure and Content

This repository is divided into two directories:

- Code
- Mapping

_Code_ is a collection of assembly code snippets. This directory is a bottom-up view of assembly language where we see assembly in its basic blocks. In this directory the code is further divided into several directories based on their platform (processor, VM, etc). Each platform will have one or more assemblers' specific code which can be compiled and linked as executable. 

_Mapping_ is a collection of mapping from high-level language such as C to assembly. This directory is a top-down view of assembly language where we see how high-level language counterpart is implemented in assembly language.

### How to Download?

You can clone the repository or download the code manually.

### How to Contribute?

This is an open project.

You can add assembly code for architecture which is not listed yet, or modifying the existing one to give better example and more clarity. To do so, you can:

- Do a pull request.
- Send mail to pengurus [at] reversing.id
- Notify us at telegram group @ReversingID
